== Overview
AntargisGUI is a C++ GUI-library, that's aimed at usage in either C++ and Ruby.
It's based upon libSDL and OpenGL and can be run in OpenGL-mode and plain SDL-mode, too.
However within the Antargis-game only OpenGL-mode is used.

Though being quiet small(TM) AntargisGUI provides a whole bunch of features, like:
* widgets, windows, buttons, list-boxes, combo-boxes, dialogs, checkboxes, edits (single and multiline), tooltips
* simple event-handling
* file-system abstraction
* UTF-8 and localization support
* XML-based layouts
* extendable through either C++ and Ruby
* basic geometry-classes (2d and 3d)
* encryption with AES
* themeable

Because the important parts are written in C++, the main documentation in done with doxygen.
So for more detailed information and a complete API-documentation go to link:../api/html/index.html 

== Dependencies (deprecated)

This library is aimed at being used by a script language like ruby or python, but it should be still
usable in plain c++.

needed libraries:
ruby(-dev)
swig(-dev)
libSDL
libSDL_image
libSDL_ttf
libSDL_mixer
libphysfs

you have 2 possibilities to compile it
1) use autotools:

2) using extconf.rb /mkmf:
